# Algorithm_Visualizer

Pretty self explanatory;
I plan to add more forms of different search and tree sort algorithms.

## Directions

Download files then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and then run "visualizer.py".
Then, follow the onscreen commands.

Alternatively, if you run "grid.py" you can visualize grid search.
At the moment, only A Star search is working with a few minor bugs
